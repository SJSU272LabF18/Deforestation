In the review of 79 case studies carried out by United States Forest Service (USFA)
, the presence of roads, especially road construction, is an important proximate cause of tropical deforestation, 
appearing in 61% of all case studies reviewed.


“95% of forest loss occurs within 50 km of a road. Scientific reports and satellite imagery 
have demonstrated road building is a major driver 
of deforestation, from the Amazon to Indonesian and Congo Basin forests,”

The UN says that 13 million hectares of forest are destroyed annually.
