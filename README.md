# Project Ideas:

## Predict deforestation due to expansion of roads/cities

Due to exponential increase in human population, cities expand to establish infrastructure. Deforestation takes place as the roads continue to extend, and this may have a negative impact on the environment. Using GIS, we can predict the amount of deforestation that can happen due to a newly proposed road construction project. We digitize the road in ArcMap to predict how much deforestation it may cause, and this may allow to take important decisions, prior to starting the road construction project. 

## Job Predictor based on Resume
   
There are a thousands of resume which are submitted to a company. It is not physically possible to check each and every application as it would be time consuming. Moreover every person has different qualities which a company is looking for and fits into it.  Hence we propose to develop an application which provides the company to input its job requirements and basic qualities a applicant must have. These things would be feeded into a machine learning classifier and a classification would be created which would determine which applicants should be notified that they are selected for the further process. 

## Air Quality Analysis

Due to increasing number of vehicles and burning of fossil fuels there is increase in carbon monoxide emission, which in turn reduces air quality. It causes damage to animals, crops, forests, and water-bodies. It also contributes to the depletion of the ozone layer, which protects the Earth from the sun's UV rays. Some of the other environmental effects of air pollution are haze, eutrophication, and global climate changes.   

We will analyse the major factors affecting air quality like temperature, CO emission, and other pollutants and predicts their intensity based on past data and give fruitful solutions to solve the air contamination problem. 

## Course recommendation for new student based on specialization and past data

Every year, prospective students go through lot of trouble for selecting courses that best suits their career goals. Universities provide a variety of choices and combinations, and a particular subject may be taught by different professors. To get the best possible plan, we analyse the historical data of past graduated students based on specialization, their course plan, and we can find the combination of exact courses, and patterns that are preferred by students. This will uncover hidden trends and help the new incoming students to choose a study plan wisely.

## California Wildfire Problem

With climate change, wildfires threaten disaster and chaos in more California communities, more often. So it is necessary to solve this problem. Hence we propose to develop an application which would predict the wildfires using different parameters which include temperature, humidity and wind, which are the main factors which affect the spread and cause for the wildfires. We would make use of machine learning models, which would use previous data of wildfires and create a classifier accordingly. This would predict a wildfire in a certain location considering the above parameters.
