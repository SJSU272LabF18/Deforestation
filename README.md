Topics:

1) Air Quality Analysis:

Due to increasing number of vehicles and burning of fossil fuels there is increase in carbon monoxide emission, which in turn reduces air quality. It causes damage to animals, crops, forests, and water-bodies. It also contributes to the depletion of the ozone layer, which protects the Earth from the sun's UV rays. Some of the other environmental effects of air pollution are haze, eutrophication, and global climate changes.   

We will analyse the major factors affecting air quality like temperature, CO emission, and other pollutants and predicts their intensity based on past data and give fruitful solutions to solve the air contamination problem. 

2) Job Predictor based on Resume
   
There are a thousands of resume which are submitted to a company. It is not physically possible to check each and every application as it would be time consuming. Moreover every person has different qualities which a company is looking for and fits into it.  Hence we propose to develop an application which provides the company to input its job requirements and basic qualities a applicant must have. These things would be feeded into a machine learning classifier and a classification would be created which would determine which applicants should be notified that they are selected for the further process.
